# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time.

### Overview
The Histoire app is a helper app for those that can't stick with their responsibilities. A timer will start three days prior to an event. Once the time for the event has been hit, another timer will start. If the event is in another location, Histoire will calculate the best route. If the second timer runs out and the duties aren't done, Histoire will keep reminding you every 15 minutes.
